#### SECURITY NOTICE ####
# Google Cloud Build (GCB) supports the usage of secrets for build requests.
# Secrets appear within GCB configs as base64-encoded strings.
# These secrets are GCP Cloud KMS-encrypted and cannot be decrypted by any human or system
# outside of GCP Cloud KMS for the GCP project this encrypted resource was created for.
# Seeing the base64-encoded encrypted blob here is not a security event for the project.
